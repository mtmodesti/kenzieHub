In this ReactJS project, i created a user CRUD with NodeJS where someone can create an account and, after that, you can login and register your techs and the nivel that you are with this skill, you can also update it. 

This project i done as a fullstack training. 

Note: I know that the type password is showed when you type in one fo the two forms, this is proposital, in the way that this is a training project.

Hope you like.
